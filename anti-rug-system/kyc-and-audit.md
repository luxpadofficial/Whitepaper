# KYC & AUDIT

Luxpad launchpad is still fully decentralized and we advise everyone to still DYOR(Do Your Own Research) but we are here to help you out with that and help project developers to prove that the project is real and has a use case using the KYC program for the project developers willing to do KYC and to have a badge(KYC) this is optional for listing in Luxpad, all are free to list their project as long as you can pay for the service fee and input all the information of your token and launch it.&#x20;

The project developers need to send documents to us to verify and do video calls if the project rug luxpad will investigate once we prove it is a rug project the copy of documents and video call verification will be published in our channel so you can file a legal action with them. (This option is optional if the project does KYC)



_**Disclaimer:** Luxpad we do not recommend any project you invest we always ask the investor to DYOR the project before investing in it. We accept no liability for any loss_
